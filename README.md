# Evolution-Roleplay
This is a SA:MP server I worked on a development team with in the past. We were all close buds and we worked off of a Godfather remix to build a roleplay server. I helped rework alot of the code, update some of the includes we used with YSL stuff, moved from file format to sql etc...


# What's with the duplicates?
I literally just searched my harddrive for .pwn files to find this old code. I worked on this code base between 2013-2015. Each file represents an update I did before recompiling the server's master code

We didn't have version control for a long time, we used to just dev literally IN PROD. LOL. Only one person devs at a time.

# What was my contribution?
* Created a fully custom dynamic player property system
* Property system included dynamic player ownable vehicles
* Dynamic player housing
* Dynamic objects/toy ownership
* Updated CMD format from default to YSL
* Flat file to SQL conversion
